Feature: Calculator

  Scenario: Adding numbers
   You can use *asciidoc markup* in _feature_ #description#.

   NOTE: This is a very important feature!

    #{IMPORTANT: Asciidoc markup inside *steps* must be surrounded by *curly brackets*.}
    Given I have numbers 1 and 2

    # {NOTE: Steps comments are placed *before* each steps so this comment is for the *WHEN* step.}

    When I sum the numbers

    # {* this is a list of itens inside a feature step}
    # {* there is no multiline comment in gherkin}
    # {** second level list item}
    Then I should have 3 as result
